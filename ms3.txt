MS3 write-up

1. Describe your record linkage model (i.e. the functions you are using and how 
you are combining their output scores) 

We used a simple linear combination of the Jaro-winkler similarity score, applied
to several different attributes in the following way:

final_score = 0.45 * sim_score(name) + 0.45 * sim_score(address) 
            + 0.1 * sim_score(zip)
            


2. Explain simple heuristic for finding/creating authoritative record.

For finding/creating an authoritative record from a group of linked records, we
selected the record with the highest average similarity score to the other records.

For example, given the linked records A, B, and C, and similarity scores:

sim(A, B) = 0.9
sim(B, C) = 0.7
sim(A, C) = 0.8

Each record has the following average similarity:

avg(A) = 0.85
avg(B) = 0.80
avg(C) = 0.75

In this case, we set A to be the authoritative record.

In cases where just 2 records match, we simply select the first record, as we do 
not have other information to break the tie.
