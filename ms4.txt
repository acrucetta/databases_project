MS4 Write-up

How we created the blocks:
We created the blocks using the zip code of each record. We assumed
that if two records have different names but are the same restaurant
they will most likely be within the same zip code. By testing with and without 
the blocking, we get the same matches, so it appears to be effective.

How we created the index:
We based the index on the name of the record. Since many records
will have similar IDs then indexing by name will speed up getting the
records. 

Average of results across MS3 and MS4:
Based of the different test results, it seems like the blocking 
didn't have a particularly different effect on the speed of the test.
My assumption is that there were not as many records or the indexing 
didn't contribute as much to the speed of the test. It seems like the more 
commits issued in the blocking-based method counterbalances the speed increases 
from blocking.  We expect that with more records, there would be greater speed 
improvements from the blocking.
